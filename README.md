# ðŸ™ŠGossip

The gossip package implements a reliable probabilistic eager broadcast protocol that enables the exchange of asynchronous messages within a distributed system without the need for a centralized message broker.
It guarantees that messages from the same publisher are delivered to the nodes in the order they were sent, but does not guarantee the order of messages from different publishers.

The protocol uses UDP to reduce the network overhead. However, this imposes a limitation on message size, which must be small enough to fit within a single UDP datagram, usually no larger than 1500 bytes (typical network MTU size).
